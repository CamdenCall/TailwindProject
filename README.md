Netflix Landing Page Made With Tailwind

I used tailwind for the responsive layout, stying for the tex and spacing.
I used normal css for the styling and animation of the buttons and form.
I wasnt a fan of the original look of the mockup so I added some border radius and blur to make it look more modern.
